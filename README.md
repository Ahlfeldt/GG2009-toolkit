General remarks: 

This toolkit allows for simple counterfactual evaluations of the effect of changes in fundamental productivity, quality of life, or effective land supply on employment, wage, and housing rent in a spatial equilibrium framework a la Glaeser &amp; Gottlieb (2009).
The mapping from the model's primitives to the endogenous objects used in the code is developed in the teaching materials for the 2024 course "Quantitative Spatial Economics" taught to students of Humboldt University and the Berlin School of Economics, which, in turn, build on Felipe Carrozi's 2023 lecture on the Rosen-Roback framework. 
All programs have been written using Stata 18. However, the code should also run on earlier versions. Programs do not use user-written ado files.
